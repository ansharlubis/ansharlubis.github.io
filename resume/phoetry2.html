        <p>"pho/etry: love, at the end of the world" is the second collaborative project by Luthfan Anshar Lubis (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ansharlubis/">@ansharlubis</a>) and Nazalea Kusuma (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thenazaleakusuma/">@thenazaleakusuma</a>) with the PHO/ETRY concept that combines photography and poetry.</p>
        <p>This time, we're inviting you to explore the stories of love at the end of the world. How does love take shape amidst the quiet, the chaos, the uncertainty, the hopelessness, and whatever else that might colour the world at its end?</p>
        <p>The theme of "pho/etry: love, at the end of the world" is both grand and groundedâ€”and it might not feel as far away as you expect. May we always have love in our days until the very end.</p>
